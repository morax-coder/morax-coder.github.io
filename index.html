                    If you have a website or a mobile app, you should draft and publish a Terms of Use Agreement (ToU). A Terms of Use agreement is essentially a contract between you and your users, and if they're drafted properly, you can rely on them in court.
                </p>
                Unlike with a Privacy Policy, there's no legal requirement to have a Terms of Use agreement. However, although it's technically unnecessary, a ToU is a vital way to protect your company's financial, legal, and business interests, all while providing a reliable and professional service to your consumers and target audience.
                <p>
                    You might be wondering what the difference is between Terms and Conditions and a Terms of Use agreement. The answer is there's no difference aside from the name.
                </p>
                Terms of Use can also be called:
                <br>
                Acceptable Use Policy
                <br>
                Terms of Service
                <br>
                Terms and Conditions
                <br>
                User Agreement
                <br>
                So, what exactly are Terms of Use agreements, who needs them, how do you create one and how do you make your agreement legally binding?
